# Medical Test Outcome Classification

This project focuses on classifying medical test outcomes into three categories: Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Through effective preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning, our approach achieved high performance and won first place in a Kaggle competition.
